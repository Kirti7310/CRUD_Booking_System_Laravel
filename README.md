ðŸ“˜ Laravel Booking System (CRUD) with Breeze Auth
This project is a simple Laravel-based Booking System that demonstrates full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with user authentication powered by Laravel Breeze. Authenticated users can manage booking records that include customer name, email, phone, booking date, and notes. The application uses Blade templating and Tailwind CSS (default from Breeze) for a clean and responsive UI. All routes related to booking management are protected and only accessible to logged-in users. This is an ideal starting point for beginners looking to learn Laravel with authentication and CRUD operations in a real-world context.
